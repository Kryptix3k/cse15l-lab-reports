# Streamlining ssh Configuration
## In this Group Choice, we created a config fle which allowed us to easier log into our ieng6 account without having to enter the long username everytime we run ssh. This allows us to log into our remote account much more efficiently and we did this through editing the config file in the ssh directory.
